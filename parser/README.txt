This folder contains various algorithms designed to parser the 
Atlas_Text_File.txt and the Encyclopedia_Text_File.txt and link them together





json file key: ---------------------------------------------

data_EN.json: json created by encyclopedia_parser.rb
data_img.json: json created by atlas_parser.rb and then hand modified to contain images 
and manuscript events

linked_data.json: resulting data from the link_gen.rb algorithm containing
metacharacters links to the encyclopedia

Note: do not delete data_img.json, it contains information written in by hand including
image links and placeholder manuscript events. If this file is deleted this work will be forever lost
although it does also exist under the history child in the VPC Fire Base.

Other than data_img.json all other data is json in this folder is reproducible by
algorithms

The final copies of json pushed to the fire base server are present in the
outer folder 've15chron-storiavenezia' as atlas_data_with_img.json and
encyclopedia_data.json. The atlas data here has randomized 'count' variables
generated from randomizer.js
--------------------------------------------------------------


The files in this folder serve the following functions:

1.----------------------------------------------------------

run atlas_parser.rb to produce data from the Atlas_Text_file.txt
the atlas parser will output a json file :data.json

the outputted json will contain two errors, one junk event at the beginning of the file
and one extra comma after the last event in the 'events' array. In the past these errors
have simply been corrected by hand

2.----------------------------------------------------------

run the encyclopedia_parser.rb to create data from the Encyclopedia_Text_file
the encyclopedia parser will output a json file: data_EN.json
and a text file: Link_File.txt

the outputted json will have the same errors as the atlas, one junk event and
one extra comma. Once again these error can be corrected by hand

Link_File.txt contains a list of strings generated by the encyclopedia parser that
can be used by link_gen.rb to generate links in the atlas data.
These strings correspond directly to captions of encyclopedia articles however any
text between '(' and ')' or containing a '/' have been removed

3.---------------------------------------------------

run link_gen.rb. to process data_img.json and the Link_File.txt
the result if this algorithm will be printed to: linked_data.json

the json outputted by this algorithm will be an exact copy of data_img.json
however meta characters 
'@' (indicating a beginning of a link) and 
'#' (indicating the end of a link)
will be inserted in the content field of the new json to indicate where a 
link to encyclopedic content exists. 

4.-----------------------------------------------------
 
run randomizer.js to randomize the count fields of the events in the array 
generated from parsing this file reads a file as specified on line 7

5.---------------------------------------------------

run tiff-remover to remove any image links to a tiff file from events json data
this file will likely not be useful
